# ðŸš€ MERN stack with Redux Toolkit!

Simple boilerplate for MERN stack with Redux Toolkit.

**Isomorphic App:**

An isomorphic app (also known as "universal app") is an application that can run both on the client and the server with the same codebase.
In the context of React, an isomorphic React app refers to an application where the React components can be rendered both on the server side and the client side.
The goal is to share as much code as possible between the server and the client to enhance performance and improve search engine optimization (SEO).


**Server-Side Rendering (SSR):**

SSR specifically refers to the process of rendering React components on the server side before sending the HTML to the client.
In SSR, the server generates the initial HTML markup for a React app, and the client then takes over to handle user interactions and dynamic updates.
SSR is a technique used in isomorphic apps to achieve faster initial page loads, improved SEO, and a better user experience.
